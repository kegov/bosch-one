properties:
    bat-max-mv:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: max voltage (charging voltage) of battery in mv
    bat-min-mv:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: min voltage (cutoff voltage) of battery in mv
    work-interval-ms:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: how often the battery level is sampled in ms
    lut-delta:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        delta mv corresponding to two successive entries in below mv-soc look-up-table. It should
        be computed like this:
        (uint32_t)(((bat_max_mv - bat_min_mv) / (sizeof(bat_mv_soc_lut)))+0.5);
    bat-mv-soc-lut:
      type: array
      required: true
      description: |
        mv-soc look-up-table for battery. First is the soc corresponding to bat min voltage 
        defined above and the final entry is the soc corresponding to bat max voltage. The delta 
        mv between successive entries is defined above
